Clearing of debris and regrading at the Portage Inn site in the Village of Westfield marks the completion of the $200,000 demolition. The historic inn sat vacant for almost 20 years after serial foreclosures left her derelict and unsafe. The Land Bank’s demolition funds were used to leverage an additional grant to build an access road and trail head for the Village.

The Land Bank embarked on a new project with Orbitist.com, a young geo-spacial data analytics and marketing firm located at the Fredonia Tech Incubator to compile and present data on county-wide housing, vacancy, blight and its impacts. Data will be tracked and used to inform the Land Bank’s strategic investments as well as its performance over time. Orbitist will map data and develop multi-media communications to highlight the resulting information for educational, marketing and advocacy applications.

The Land Bank successfully applied for three grants, providing vital funding for operations, work force assistance and renovation subsidies for a new program that will cultivate responsible local land lords of quality affordable housing.
