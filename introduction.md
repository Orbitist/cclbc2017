# Mission of the Chautauqua County Land Bank Corporation

Control and manage strategically selected dilapidated and abandoned residential and commercial properties acquired through the County tax foreclosure process, bank foreclosures and/or donations, and facilitate solutions aimed at stabilizing neighborhoods, encouraging private investment, and improving the quality of life throughout Chautauqua County.

By 2016, the Land Bank secured over $2.86 million dollars in public grant funding, and leveraged over $1.65 million in private investment in the interventions of more than 173 vacant or abandoned properties in the county.
